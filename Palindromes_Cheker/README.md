# Palindromes Checker

This is a simple project that checks whether a given word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because when it is spelled backward, it still reads "racecar."
