        <h3>What is a Palindrome?</h3>
        <p>A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because when it is spelled backward, it still reads "racecar." Palindromes can be found in many languages, and they have fascinated people for centuries. Some people even create palindromic sentences and stories, which can be read the same way forward and backward. Palindromes are a fun way to play with language and explore its properties.</p>
